# Autodesk Fusion and CAM

## Introduction
Fusion 360 is a computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) software developed by Autodesk. 

## Significance of G and M codes
G and M codes are the most common codes used in CNC machines. G codes are used to control the movement of the machine and M codes are used to control the machine's functions.

## Using Fusion for CAM
- Open fusion and create a new design.

## Machine setup
Every machine has a different setup, different table sizes and different work holding methods. Fusion 360 allows you to define the machine setup and the work holding method you will be using.
## Tools
In order to use Fusion 360 for CAM, you need to define the tools you will be using. This includes the end mills, drills, and other tools you will be using to machine your part.

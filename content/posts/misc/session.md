# Embedded systems

An embedded system is a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts.

**Parts of a microcontroller**
A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. Here are the key hardware components of a microcontroller:

1. **Processor Core**: This is the brain of the microcontroller. It executes the instructions of a program, which controls the function of the microcontroller.
2. **Memory**: This includes both RAM (Random Access Memory) for temporary storage of data and ROM (Read-Only Memory) for storing the program code. Some microcontrollers may also have EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) or flash memory that can be reprogrammed.
3. **Input/Output (I/O) Ports**: These allow the microcontroller to interface with other devices or components. They can be programmed to be inputs or outputs.
4. **Timers/Counters**: These are used for tasks like measuring time intervals, generating delays, and counting events.
5. **Serial Communication Interfaces**: These allow the microcontroller to communicate with other devices or microcontrollers. They can include interfaces like UART, SPI, and I2C.
6. **Analog to Digital/Digital to Analog Converters (ADC/DAC)**: ADCs convert analog signals (like sensor readings) to digital values that the microcontroller can process. DACs do the opposite, converting digital values to analog signals.
7. **Interrupt Controller**: This handles interrupts, which are signals that can pause the main program execution to run specific code.
8. **Power Management**: This controls the power usage of the microcontroller, and can include features like sleep modes to reduce power consumption.
9. **Debugging Interface**: This allows programmers to debug the microcontroller, and can include features like breakpoints and watchpoints.

## I2C
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), pronounced "I-squared-C", is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave, packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus invented by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors). It is widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication.

Here are some types of embedded components that commonly use the I2C standard:

1. **Sensors**: Many sensors, like temperature sensors, pressure sensors, and accelerometers, use I2C for communication. An example is the BMP280 barometric pressure sensor.
2. **Display Controllers**: Some small LCD or OLED displays use I2C to receive data and commands. An example is the SSD1306 OLED display controller.
3. **EEPROMs**: Some types of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) use I2C for data transfer. An example is the AT24C series of EEPROMs.
4. **Real-Time Clocks (RTCs)**: RTCs often use I2C for setting and retrieving the time. An example is the DS1307 RTC.
5. **Digital-to-Analog and Analog-to-Digital Converters**: Some DACs and ADCs use I2C for receiving data or sending results. Examples include the PCF8591 and MCP4725.

Remember that while these components often use I2C, they may also support other communication protocols like SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). Always check the datasheet of the specific component to know which communication protocols it supports.

## Power supply
Power management in embedded systems refers to the techniques and strategies used to reduce power consumption and extend the operational life of battery-powered devices. This is particularly important in embedded systems as they are often deployed in environments where power is scarce or difficult to replenish, such as remote sensor nodes or portable devices.

Here are some common power management techniques in embedded systems:

1. **Dynamic Power Management (DPM)**: This involves dynamically adjusting the power state of the system based on the current workload. For example, a processor might be put into a low-power sleep mode when not in use, and woken up when needed.
2. **Voltage Scaling**: This involves adjusting the operating voltage of a device to reduce power consumption. This can be static (set at design time) or dynamic (adjusted in real-time based on workload).
3. **Clock Gating**: This involves turning off the clock signal to parts of the system that are not in use, effectively putting them in a low-power state.
4. **Power Gating**: This involves cutting off power to parts of the system that are not in use.
5. **Use of Low-Power Components**: Designing the system with components that have low power consumption can also help reduce overall power usage.
6. **Efficient Software Design**: Software can also play a role in power management. For example, efficient algorithms that complete tasks quickly can allow the processor to return to a low-power state sooner.

Remember, the exact power management techniques used can vary greatly depending on the specific requirements of the embedded system.

## STM32

# Kubernetes

**Kubernetes**, often abbreviated as **K8s**, is an open-source project that originated at Google. Version one of Kubernetes was released in **July 2015**. It was the third generation of container schedulers from Google, following previous projects like Borg and Omega. Google later donated Kubernetes to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which now supervises its development.

Its primary purpose is to serve as the **leading container orchestration tool**. It is designed as a loosely coupled collection of components for **deploying, managing, and scaling containers**. Kubernetes is vendor-neutral, meaning it is not tied to a single company and can run on all cloud providers. There is also a significant community ecosystem surrounding it.

Kubernetes facilitates a range of functionalities, including:
- Service Discovery
- Load balancing
- Bridging to cloud providers' storage services
- Providing rollout and rollback capabilities
- Monitoring the health of containers
- Managing configuration and secrets
- Offering a consistent API across both on-premise solutions and various cloud providers

However, Kubernetes does not deploy or build your code, nor does it provide application-level services such as databases, service buses, or caches. It is an essential component of a cloud-native application architecture, often used alongside microservices. When adopting a cloud-native approach, it is recommended to use an orchestrator like Kubernetes and automate deployment through continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) techniques and tools.

## Installing

Installing Docker is straightforward, but the process is different for each operating system. You should always check the official Docker website for the latest version and the most up-to-date instructions.


### üñ•Ô∏è Windows

The recommended way to install Docker on Windows is with **Docker Desktop**, which is a one-click installer for your PC. It bundles the Docker Engine, Docker CLI, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes into a single, easy-to-use application.

1.  **System Requirements**:

      * Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education version 21H2 (build 19044) or higher.
      * Windows 11 64-bit: Home or Pro version 21H2 or higher, or Enterprise or Education version 21H2 or higher.
      * 4GB of RAM.
      * Hardware virtualization support enabled in BIOS.
      * **WSL 2 backend**: Required for most modern Windows installations.
      * **Hyper-V backend**: An alternative for systems that can't use WSL 2.

2.  **Installation Steps**:

      * Download the **Docker Desktop installer** from the official Docker website.
      * Double-click the `.exe` file to run the installer.
      * Follow the installation wizard's instructions.
      * After installation, the application will automatically start. You may be prompted to accept the Docker Subscription Service Agreement.
      * **Verify the installation** by opening a terminal (like PowerShell or Command Prompt) and running `docker --version`.

### üçè Mac

Just like on Windows, the easiest way to get Docker on a Mac is by using **Docker Desktop for Mac**. It also includes the Docker Engine, CLI, and other tools, and runs a lightweight Linux VM to host the containers.

1.  **System Requirements**:

      * macOS 10.15 Catalina or newer.
      * 4GB of RAM.
      * For Apple Silicon (M1, M2) chips, Rosetta 2 is recommended for some optional command-line tools.

2.  **Installation Steps**:

      * Download the **Docker Desktop installer** (`.dmg` file) for your specific Mac chip (Apple Silicon or Intel) from the official Docker website.
      * Open the `.dmg` file and drag the Docker icon into your Applications folder.
      * Navigate to your Applications folder and launch Docker Desktop.
      * The first time you run it, you'll have to accept the subscription agreement and enter your Mac's password to configure networking components.
      * **Verify the installation** by opening a terminal and running `docker --version`.

### üêß Linux

On Linux, you can either install Docker Desktop or install the **Docker Engine** directly from the package repositories. Installing the engine is the more common approach.

#### Docker Desktop for Linux

Docker Desktop is now available for some Linux distributions, including Ubuntu and Fedora. This is a good option if you want a graphical interface to manage your containers.

1.  **Installation Steps (for Ubuntu)**:
      * Update your system's packages: `sudo apt update`.
      * Download the `.deb` package from the Docker website.
      * Install the package: `sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<arch>.deb` (replace `<arch>` with your system architecture).
      * Launch Docker Desktop from your applications menu.

#### Docker Engine (using package manager)

This is the standard and most flexible way to install Docker on Linux. The steps vary slightly depending on your distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora).

1.  **Ubuntu/Debian**:
      * Update your package list: `sudo apt-get update`.
      * Install necessary dependencies: `sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg`.
      * Add Docker's official GPG key and repository:
        ```sh
        sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
        curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
        sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
        echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
        ```
      * Install Docker Engine: `sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin`.
      * **Add your user to the `docker` group** to run commands without `sudo`: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. You must log out and back in for this to take effect.
      * **Verify the installation** by running a test container: `docker run hello-world`.

## Basic commands
- kubectl run testcubeimage --image=hello-world --port=80
- kubectl delete pod testcubeimage
- kubectl describe pods

# Running llama on a Raspberry Pi

## Inroduction
LLM's are genrally a very compute intensive task and do require a lot of high end hardware to run hence making it virtually impossible to run on regular hardware and most of the LLM's are closed source. But there are a few LLM's that are free to download and simplified so that they do not need a huge amount of computational power to run.

## Prerequisites
1. Raspberry Pi 4/5 (4GB+ RAM)
2. Raspberry Pi OS
3. Internet connection
4. Free space of atleast 4GB
5. A bit of linux commands (nothing serious tho)

## Here we go

1. First we need to connect to Raspberry Pi, you can do this via [SSH] [VNC] or directly connecting a monitor and keyboard to it. We'll be using SSH for this tutorial.

CNN General Architecture
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model that is commonly used for image processing tasks. The general architecture of a CNN usually consists of three types of layers: Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and Fully Connected Layer.


Convolutional Layer: This is the core building block of a CNN. The layer&rsquo;s parameters consist of a set of learnable filters (or kernels), which have a small receptive field, but extend through the full depth of the input volume. During the forward pass, each filter is convolved across the width and height of the input volume, computing the dot product between the entries of the filter and the input and producing a 2-dimensional activation map of that filter. As a result, the network learns filters that activate when it detects some specific type of feature at some spatial position in the input."><meta name=author content="Aum Pauskar"><link rel=canonical href=http://localhost:40429/blog/posts/ml/ans/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/blog/assets/css/stylesheet.fc220c15db4aef0318bbf30adc45d33d4d7c88deff3238b23eb255afdc472ca6.css integrity="sha256-/CIMFdtK7wMYu/MK3EXTPU18iN7/MjiyPrJVr9xHLKY=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=http://localhost:40429/blog/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=http://localhost:40429/blog/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=http://localhost:40429/blog/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=http://localhost:40429/blog/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=http://localhost:40429/blog/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=http://localhost:40429/blog/posts/ml/ans/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-EV8NVH4QG5"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-EV8NVH4QG5")}</script><meta property="og:title" content="Ans"><meta property="og:description" content="Image analysis answers

The general architecture of a CNN usually consists of three types of layers: Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and Fully Connected Layer.\nConvolutional Layer: This is the core building block of a CNN. The layer’s parameters consist of a set of learnable filters (or kernels), which have a small receptive field, but extend through the full depth of the input volume. During the forward pass, each filter is convolved across the width and height of the input volume, computing the dot product between the entries of the filter and the input and producing a 2-dimensional activation map of that filter. As a result, the network learns filters that activate when it detects some specific type of feature at some spatial position in the input.\nPooling Layer: The objective is to down-sample an input representation, reducing its dimensionality and allowing for assumptions to be made about features contained in the sub-regions binned. This is done to in part to help over-fitting by providing an abstracted form of the representation. As well, it reduces the computational cost by reducing the number of parameters to learn.\nFully Connected Layer: Neurons in a fully connected layer have full connections to all activations in the previous layer, as seen in regular Neural Networks. Their activations can hence be computed with a matrix multiplication followed by a bias offset.\nConvolution Calculation with Image Segment 5X5 Convolve with Kernel of 3X3\nLet’s say we have a 5x5 image (I) and a 3x3 kernel (K):\n1 2 3 4 5 I = |1 1 1 0 0| K = |1 0 1| |0 1 1 1 0| |0 1 0| |0 0 1 1 1| |1 0 1| |0 0 1 1 0| |0 1 1 0 0| To convolve the image with the kernel, we slide the kernel over the image, and for each position, we compute the element-wise multiplication of the kernel with the part of the image it’s currently on, and then sum up all the results into a single output pixel. The result is a 3x3 output (since the kernel can be placed in 3x3 different positions on the image):\n1 2 3 O = |4 3 4| |2 4 3| |2 3 4| Pooling, Min, Max, Avg Pool Definition and Calculation\nPooling layers reduce the dimensions of the data by combining the outputs of neuron clusters at one layer into a single neuron in the next layer. There are several types of pooling operations, but the most common ones are Max Pooling, Average Pooling, and Min Pooling.\nMax Pooling: Calculate the maximum value for each patch of the feature map. Average Pooling: Calculate the average value for each patch on the feature map. Min Pooling: Calculate the minimum value for each patch of the feature map. For example, if we apply 2x2 max pooling to the output above, we get:\n1 2 P = |4| |4| This is because 4 is the maximum value in each 2x2 region of the output.\nU-net architecture - encoder, skip connection and decoder\nU-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture that was developed for biomedical image segmentation. It’s named U-Net because of its U-shaped architecture. The architecture consists of three parts: an encoder (contracting path), a decoder (expanding path), and skip connections.\nEncoder: The encoder part of U-Net is a typical convolutional network that consists of repeated application of two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded), each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a 2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling. As we move deeper into the network, the number of feature channels is doubled at each downsampling step.\nSkip Connections: Skip connections are a distinctive feature of U-Net. They connect the output of an encoder layer to the corresponding decoder layer. These connections provide a shortcut that allows the gradient to be directly backpropagated to earlier layers. They also allow the decoder to access the original features, which helps to precisely localize and reconstruct the input image’s details.\nDecoder: The decoder part of U-Net upsamples the feature map and concatenates it with the feature map from the corresponding encoder layer (via a skip connection). This concatenated feature map is then convolved to produce the final output. The upsampling of feature map is done using a 2x2 up-convolution. After each upsampling, two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded) followed by a ReLU are applied.\nThe final layer of the U-Net is a 1x1 convolution used to map each 64-component feature vector to the desired number of classes.\nSegmentation and automatic segmentation\nSegmentation in the context of image processing is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments, often with the goal of identifying and isolating specific objects or features. Each segment, also known as a pixel set or region, typically shares certain characteristics, such as color, intensity, or texture. Segmentation is a crucial step in image analysis and interpretation, as it allows for the extraction of meaningful information from an image.\nFor example, in medical imaging, segmentation might be used to isolate a specific organ, tissue, or abnormality, such as a tumor, from the rest of an image. This can aid in diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring.\nAutomatic segmentation, as the name suggests, involves using algorithms to perform the segmentation process without human intervention. These algorithms can range from simple thresholding methods to more complex machine learning and deep learning techniques.\nAutomatic segmentation has several advantages. It can be much faster and more consistent than manual segmentation, especially for large datasets. It can also potentially identify features or patterns that might be missed by the human eye.\nHowever, automatic segmentation also has its challenges. It can be difficult to design an algorithm that performs well across a wide range of images, especially if the images vary in quality or the features of interest are subtle or complex. Therefore, automatic segmentation algorithms often need to be trained on a large dataset of labeled images, and their performance must be carefully validated.\nSignificance of labeling in segmentation and classification\nLabeling in segmentation and classification has several significant roles:\nTraining Supervised Learning Models: Labels are essential for training supervised machine learning models. In both segmentation and classification, the model learns to predict the labels based on the input data. For example, in image segmentation, the model learns to predict the class of each pixel (e.g., tumor or not tumor) based on labeled training images.\nEvaluating Model Performance: Labels are used to evaluate the performance of the model. By comparing the model’s predictions to the true labels, we can calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\nProviding Ground Truth: Labels provide a “ground truth” that the model can learn from. In a medical imaging context, these labels are often provided by expert radiologists.\nEnabling Fine-Grained Analysis: In segmentation tasks, labels can enable more fine-grained analysis. For example, instead of just classifying an entire image as containing a tumor or not, segmentation can identify the exact location and shape of the tumor.\nImproving Model Interpretability: Labels can help to make the model’s predictions more interpretable. By knowing what each class represents, we can better understand and trust the model’s predictions.\nHow is the localization of areas of interest accomplished in biomedical image processing, and what significance does this process hold for enhancing the analysis and interpretation of medical images?\nLocalization of areas of interest in biomedical image processing is typically accomplished through a process called segmentation. Segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments, or sets of pixels, often based on pixel intensity. In the context of biomedical imaging, these segments often correspond to different anatomical structures or regions of interest (ROIs).\nThere are several techniques for image segmentation, including thresholding, edge detection, region-growing, and more complex methods like machine learning and deep learning. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for segmentation tasks in biomedical imaging due to their ability to learn complex patterns and structures in image data.\nThe significance of this process for enhancing the analysis and interpretation of medical images is immense:\nImproved Diagnosis: By accurately localizing and outlining areas of interest, such as tumors or lesions, doctors can make more accurate diagnoses.\nQuantitative Analysis: Segmentation allows for quantitative analysis of the ROIs, such as measuring the size, shape, or volume of a tumor over time.\nTreatment Planning: In fields like radiation therapy, precise segmentation is crucial for planning treatment strategies and avoiding damage to healthy tissues.\nResearch: In biomedical research, segmentation can help in understanding the structure-function relationships in biological systems, studying disease progression, and evaluating treatment responses.\nBinary, multi labelled and milt-class classification - x-ray, CT COVID 19 classification case study and implementation.\nBinary, multi-label, and multi-class classification are different types of classification tasks in machine learning.\nBinary Classification: This is the simplest type of classification, where each input is classified into one of two classes. For example, an X-ray image could be classified as either “normal” or “COVID-19”.\nMulti-label Classification: In this type of classification, each input can belong to multiple classes. For example, a CT scan could be labeled with multiple conditions such as “COVID-19”, “pneumonia”, and “lung cancer”.\nMulti-class Classification: This is a generalization of binary classification where each input is classified into one of more than two classes. For example, a CT scan could be classified as “normal”, “COVID-19”, “pneumonia”, or “lung cancer”.\nIn the case of COVID-19 classification using X-ray or CT images, machine learning models can be trained to identify images that show signs of COVID-19. The process typically involves the following steps:\nData Collection: Collect a large number of X-ray or CT images that have been labeled with their respective conditions. These can be obtained from public datasets or hospitals.\nPreprocessing: The images are preprocessed to enhance the quality and remove noise. This can involve resizing, normalization, and other transformations.\nModel Training: A machine learning model (such as a convolutional neural network) is trained on the preprocessed images. The model learns to identify the features in the images that correspond to the different conditions.\nEvaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model is typically evaluated using a separate test set of images that were not used during training.\nImplementation: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be implemented in a clinical setting to assist in diagnosing COVID-19 from X-ray or CT images.\nMRI image automatic segmentation and classification of tumor with standard benchmark image datasets\nMRI image automatic segmentation and classification of tumors involves several steps and typically uses machine learning or deep learning techniques. Here’s a general overview of the process:\nData Collection: The first step is to collect a large number of MRI images that have been labeled with the location and type of tumors. These images are often collected from public benchmark datasets such as BRATS (Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge), which provides a large number of MRI scans with expert annotations of gliomas, a common type of brain tumor.\nPreprocessing: The MRI images are preprocessed to enhance the quality and remove noise. This can involve normalization, resizing, and other transformations. The goal is to ensure that the images are in a suitable format for the machine learning model.\nSegmentation: The next step is to segment the MRI images to identify the regions that contain the tumor. This is typically done using a deep learning model such as a U-Net, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is particularly good at biomedical image segmentation. The model is trained on the labeled images from the dataset, learning to identify the features that indicate the presence of a tumor.\nClassification: After the tumor regions have been identified, another model can be used to classify the type of tumor. This could be a simple binary classification (tumor or no tumor), or a multi-class classification if there are multiple types of tumors that need to be identified.\nEvaluation: The performance of the segmentation and classification models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the Dice coefficient. The models are typically evaluated using a separate test set of images that were not used during training.\nImplementation: Once the models have been trained and evaluated, they can be implemented in a clinical setting to assist radiologists in diagnosing and treating brain tumors.\nThis is a high-level overview of the process. The exact details can vary depending on the specific techniques and tools used.\n","wordCount":"2127","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-01-10T08:20:19+05:30","dateModified":"2024-01-10T08:20:19+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Aum Pauskar"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:40429/blog/posts/ml/ans/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Aum's blogging site","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:40429/blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:40429/blog/ accesskey=h title="Aum's blogging site (Alt + H)">Aum's blogging site</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:40429/blog/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:40429/blog/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Ans

The architecture consists of three parts: an encoder (contracting path), a decoder (expanding path), and skip connections.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Encoder</strong>: The encoder part of U-Net is a typical convolutional network that consists of repeated application of two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded), each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a 2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling. As we move deeper into the network, the number of feature channels is doubled at each downsampling step.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skip Connections</strong>: Skip connections are a distinctive feature of U-Net. They connect the output of an encoder layer to the corresponding decoder layer. These connections provide a shortcut that allows the gradient to be directly backpropagated to earlier layers. They also allow the decoder to access the original features, which helps to precisely localize and reconstruct the input image&rsquo;s details.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decoder</strong>: The decoder part of U-Net upsamples the feature map and concatenates it with the feature map from the corresponding encoder layer (via a skip connection). This concatenated feature map is then convolved to produce the final output. The upsampling of feature map is done using a 2x2 up-convolution. After each upsampling, two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded) followed by a ReLU are applied.</p></li></ol><p>The final layer of the U-Net is a 1x1 convolution used to map each 64-component feature vector to the desired number of classes.</p></li><li><p>Segmentation and automatic segmentation</p><p><strong>Segmentation</strong> in the context of image processing is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments, often with the goal of identifying and isolating specific objects or features. Each segment, also known as a pixel set or region, typically shares certain characteristics, such as color, intensity, or texture. Segmentation is a crucial step in image analysis and interpretation, as it allows for the extraction of meaningful information from an image.</p><p>For example, in medical imaging, segmentation might be used to isolate a specific organ, tissue, or abnormality, such as a tumor, from the rest of an image. This can aid in diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring.</p><p><strong>Automatic segmentation</strong>, as the name suggests, involves using algorithms to perform the segmentation process without human intervention. These algorithms can range from simple thresholding methods to more complex machine learning and deep learning techniques.</p><p>Automatic segmentation has several advantages. It can be much faster and more consistent than manual segmentation, especially for large datasets. It can also potentially identify features or patterns that might be missed by the human eye.</p><p>However, automatic segmentation also has its challenges. It can be difficult to design an algorithm that performs well across a wide range of images, especially if the images vary in quality or the features of interest are subtle or complex. Therefore, automatic segmentation algorithms often need to be trained on a large dataset of labeled images, and their performance must be carefully validated.</p></li><li><p>Significance of labeling in segmentation and classification</p><p>Labeling in segmentation and classification has several significant roles:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Training Supervised Learning Models</strong>: Labels are essential for training supervised machine learning models. In both segmentation and classification, the model learns to predict the labels based on the input data. For example, in image segmentation, the model learns to predict the class of each pixel (e.g., tumor or not tumor) based on labeled training images.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluating Model Performance</strong>: Labels are used to evaluate the performance of the model. By comparing the model&rsquo;s predictions to the true labels, we can calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.</p></li><li><p><strong>Providing Ground Truth</strong>: Labels provide a &ldquo;ground truth&rdquo; that the model can learn from. In a medical imaging context, these labels are often provided by expert radiologists.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enabling Fine-Grained Analysis</strong>: In segmentation tasks, labels can enable more fine-grained analysis. For example, instead of just classifying an entire image as containing a tumor or not, segmentation can identify the exact location and shape of the tumor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improving Model Interpretability</strong>: Labels can help to make the model&rsquo;s predictions more interpretable. By knowing what each class represents, we can better understand and trust the model&rsquo;s predictions.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>How is the localization of areas of interest accomplished in biomedical image processing, and what significance does this process hold for enhancing the analysis and interpretation of medical images?</p><p>Localization of areas of interest in biomedical image processing is typically accomplished through a process called segmentation. Segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments, or sets of pixels, often based on pixel intensity. In the context of biomedical imaging, these segments often correspond to different anatomical structures or regions of interest (ROIs).</p><p>There are several techniques for image segmentation, including thresholding, edge detection, region-growing, and more complex methods like machine learning and deep learning. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for segmentation tasks in biomedical imaging due to their ability to learn complex patterns and structures in image data.</p><p>The significance of this process for enhancing the analysis and interpretation of medical images is immense:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Improved Diagnosis</strong>: By accurately localizing and outlining areas of interest, such as tumors or lesions, doctors can make more accurate diagnoses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quantitative Analysis</strong>: Segmentation allows for quantitative analysis of the ROIs, such as measuring the size, shape, or volume of a tumor over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Treatment Planning</strong>: In fields like radiation therapy, precise segmentation is crucial for planning treatment strategies and avoiding damage to healthy tissues.</p></li><li><p><strong>Research</strong>: In biomedical research, segmentation can help in understanding the structure-function relationships in biological systems, studying disease progression, and evaluating treatment responses.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Binary, multi labelled and milt-class classification - x-ray, CT COVID 19 classification case study and implementation.</p><p>Binary, multi-label, and multi-class classification are different types of classification tasks in machine learning.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Binary Classification</strong>: This is the simplest type of classification, where each input is classified into one of two classes. For example, an X-ray image could be classified as either &ldquo;normal&rdquo; or &ldquo;COVID-19&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-label Classification</strong>: In this type of classification, each input can belong to multiple classes. For example, a CT scan could be labeled with multiple conditions such as &ldquo;COVID-19&rdquo;, &ldquo;pneumonia&rdquo;, and &ldquo;lung cancer&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-class Classification</strong>: This is a generalization of binary classification where each input is classified into one of more than two classes. For example, a CT scan could be classified as &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, &ldquo;COVID-19&rdquo;, &ldquo;pneumonia&rdquo;, or &ldquo;lung cancer&rdquo;.</p></li></ol><p>In the case of COVID-19 classification using X-ray or CT images, machine learning models can be trained to identify images that show signs of COVID-19. The process typically involves the following steps:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Collect a large number of X-ray or CT images that have been labeled with their respective conditions. These can be obtained from public datasets or hospitals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Preprocessing</strong>: The images are preprocessed to enhance the quality and remove noise. This can involve resizing, normalization, and other transformations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Model Training</strong>: A machine learning model (such as a convolutional neural network) is trained on the preprocessed images. The model learns to identify the features in the images that correspond to the different conditions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluation</strong>: The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model is typically evaluated using a separate test set of images that were not used during training.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implementation</strong>: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be implemented in a clinical setting to assist in diagnosing COVID-19 from X-ray or CT images.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>MRI image automatic segmentation and classification of tumor with standard benchmark image datasets</p><p>MRI image automatic segmentation and classification of tumors involves several steps and typically uses machine learning or deep learning techniques. Here&rsquo;s a general overview of the process:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Data Collection</strong>: The first step is to collect a large number of MRI images that have been labeled with the location and type of tumors. These images are often collected from public benchmark datasets such as BRATS (Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge), which provides a large number of MRI scans with expert annotations of gliomas, a common type of brain tumor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Preprocessing</strong>: The MRI images are preprocessed to enhance the quality and remove noise. This can involve normalization, resizing, and other transformations. The goal is to ensure that the images are in a suitable format for the machine learning model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Segmentation</strong>: The next step is to segment the MRI images to identify the regions that contain the tumor. This is typically done using a deep learning model such as a U-Net, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is particularly good at biomedical image segmentation. The model is trained on the labeled images from the dataset, learning to identify the features that indicate the presence of a tumor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Classification</strong>: After the tumor regions have been identified, another model can be used to classify the type of tumor. This could be a simple binary classification (tumor or no tumor), or a multi-class classification if there are multiple types of tumors that need to be identified.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluation</strong>: The performance of the segmentation and classification models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the Dice coefficient. The models are typically evaluated using a separate test set of images that were not used during training.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implementation</strong>: Once the models have been trained and evaluated, they can be implemented in a clinical setting to assist radiologists in diagnosing and treating brain tumors.</p></li></ol><p>This is a high-level overview of the process. The exact details can vary depending on the specific techniques and tools used.</p></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=http://localhost:40429/blog/posts/misc/autodeskfusion/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Autodesk Fusion and CAM</span>

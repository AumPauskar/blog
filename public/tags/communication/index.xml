      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;computer-networks&#34;&gt;Computer networks&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;packets&#34;&gt;Packets&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks*, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them. The Internet is a &amp;ldquo;packet switching&amp;rdquo; network. Packet switching refers to the ability of networking equipment to process packets independently from each other. It also means that packets can take different network paths to the same destination, so long as they all arrive at the destination. Because of packet switching, packets from multiple computers can travel over the same wires in basically any order. This enables multiple connections to take place over the same networking equipment at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

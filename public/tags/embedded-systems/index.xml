      <description>Raspberry Pi The raspberry pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries.&#xA;Setting up Raspberry Pi As standard the Raspberry Pi comes without an operating system. It depends on the user which operating system is installed within the computer. The operating system can be installed on the Raspberry Pi using the following steps:</description>

      <description>ARM Basics Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) is a family of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures for computer processors, configured for various environments. Arm Holdings develops the architecture and licenses it to other companies, who design their own products that implement one of those architectures‍—‌including systems-on-chips (SoC) and systems-on-modules (SoM) that incorporate memory, interfaces, radios, etc. It also designs cores that implement this instruction set and licenses these designs to a number of companies that incorporate those core designs into their own products.</description>

      <description>Embedded C Embedded C is used in embedded systems and iot deviced such as Arduino and mico IC&amp;rsquo;s. To emulate this we can use Keil, however this can be only run on Windows, to run this on linux based distros use wine.&#xA;Procedure to run The following are the steps to run a code on Keil Note: Here we are working on intel 8051AH microcontroller&#xA;Install and run keil If you are on a windows system you can run the exe file locally, if you are on a linux machine you can run keil through wine and it will function just like you are running it on windows natively.</description>

# Aum's blog

A blogging site made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using [papermod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) theme. Contains all the technical stuff I have learned over the years, some of my projects and some of my thoughts.

## Basic setup 
1. Install hugo
    - Debian based OS (PopOS, Ubuntu, Linux Mint)
        ```bash
        sudo apt install hugo
        ```
        However this may give an outdated version of Hugo so may not be compatable with some themes within the hugo themes community, installing with snap would likely give a newer version to install.
        ```bash
        sudo snap install hugo
        ```
    - RHEL and Fedora
        ```
        sudo dnf install hugo
        ```
    - Arch linux
        ```
        sudo pacman -S hugo
        ```

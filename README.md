# Aum's blog

A blogging site made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using [papermod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) theme. Contains all the technical stuff I have learned over the years, some of my projects and some of my thoughts.

## Basic setup üîß
1. Install hugo
    - Debian based OS (PopOS, Ubuntu, Linux Mint)
        ```bash
        sudo apt install hugo
        ```
        However this may give an outdated version of Hugo so may not be compatable with some themes within the hugo themes community, installing with snap would likely give a newer version to install.
        ```bash
        sudo snap install hugo
        ```
    - RHEL and Fedora
        ```
        sudo dnf install hugo
        ```
    - Arch linux
        ```
        sudo pacman -S hugo
        ```

## Creating new files üìÑ
To create a new post, run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
hugo new --kind post content/posts/<directory>/<filename>.md
```

## Working online üåê
The project is designed to be worked online without any need for the volunteer/contributor to download the project or add any dependencies in the local environment. Just having a modern browser gives you the full ability to modifyh and edit the code.

**How does it work**üí°
The application uses GitHub actions to do CI/CD in the web, this includes everything from creating new files with the preexisitng Hugo template, compiling everythingn in a github artifact and deploying into the web.

### Creating a new file - online 
![github actions list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AumPauskar/repo-media/8521e3544e2ec012bc35482ae009a64e1b2055cd/blog/hugo_github_actions.png)
- Open the GitHub actions tab in the actions tab and you'll see three options
- Use "Create New Hugo Post" option in the webpage.
- The action would ask about the file's root folder (within content/posts) and file's name (you have to add without the `.md` extension).

### Building the hugo site
The Hugo site is built automatically upon every push so the contributor doesn't need to manually trigger anything.

### Deploying the site
Click on the "Deploy Hugo site to Pages" and click run and the pages would run and deploy on the web ASAP.
